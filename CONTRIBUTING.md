## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find that the problem has already been reported.

When you create a bug report, please include:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Device information** (iOS version, device model, etc.)
- **App version**

### Suggesting Enhancements

### Code Contributions

#### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project.

#### Areas Where We Need Help

- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage
- Documentation
- Accessibility features
- Internationalization/Localization
- Additional currency support
- Historical rate charts

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Critical fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request

## Style Guidelines

### Swift Code Style

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/):

- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and types
- Follow Swift naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for types)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### SwiftUI Guidelines

- Prefer `@State` for local view state
- Use `@StateObject` for view models
- Use `@ObservedObject` for passed-in objects
- Keep views small and focused
- Extract reusable components into separate views

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow MVVM architecture principles
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Write testable code
- Keep business logic in ViewModels
- Use protocols for abstractions

### File Organization

```
Our Currency Converter/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/              # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # Business logic and networking
â”œâ”€â”€ viewmodels/         # ViewModels
â”œâ”€â”€ views/              # SwiftUI views
â””â”€â”€ Assets.xcassets/    # App assets
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(converter): add historical rate chart
fix(api): handle network timeout errors
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(viewmodel): add tests for error handling
style(ui): improve button spacing
refactor(service): extract rate fetching logic
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. Run all tests and ensure they pass (`Cmd+U` in Xcode)
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Rebase your branch on the latest `develop`
6. Ensure the app builds and runs without errors

### Pull Request Template

When creating a PR, please include:

- **Description** - Clear description of what the PR does
- **Type of Change** - Bug fix, new feature, documentation, etc.
- **Testing** - How you tested your changes
- **Screenshots** - If UI changes are involved
- **Checklist** - Ensure all requirements are met

### Review Process

1. At least one maintainer must approve the PR
2. All CI checks must pass (when implemented)
3. No merge conflicts
4. Code must follow project standards
5. Tests must pass

### After Approval

- PRs are typically merged by maintainers
- Your branch will be deleted after merge
- Thank you for your contribution! ðŸŽ‰

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Services
- Use dependency injection for testable code
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, etc.)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure

```swift
func testLoadRatesSuccess() async {
    // Given
    let mockService = MockCurrencyServiceSuccess()
    let viewModel = CurrencyViewModel(service: mockService)
    
    // When
    await viewModel.loadRates()
    
    // Then
    await MainActor.run {
        XCTAssertEqual(viewModel.rates["USD"], 0.20)
        XCTAssertNil(viewModel.errorMessage)
    }
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# In Xcode: Cmd+U
# Command line:
xcodebuild test -scheme "Our Currency Converter" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15"
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use Swift documentation format
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Provide usage examples when helpful

```swift
/// Fetches current exchange rates from the API
/// - Returns: Dictionary mapping currency codes to exchange rates
/// - Throws: NetworkError if the request fails
func fetchRates() async throws -> [String: Double]
```

### README Updates

- Keep README.md up to date with new features
- Update screenshots when UI changes
- Add new dependencies to the tech stack section
